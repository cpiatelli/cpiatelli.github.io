  <h1>About Chris Piatelli</h1>
  <p>I’m a full time hockey and lacrosse coach and a college advisor, living in Marblehead, MA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I have been managing a website for my hockey and lacrosse organization using WordPress and I want to become more skilled. I also would like to use a different program than WordPress.  My wife and I are also looking to start a business and would like to manage our own website.</p>

  <h2>My Mission</h2>
