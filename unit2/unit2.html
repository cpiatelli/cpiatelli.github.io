	<h1>Setting Goals for Your Site</h1>
	
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>I am inspired by the following websites:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Air BNB</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.snowbird.com/" target="_blank">Snowbird</a></li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>How are they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Air BNB</a> website uses a rotation of movies and still photos as the header, which pulls your eye to the reason why you're visiting them in the first place.  There is a search bar below this, which is simple and allows you to put in where, when, and how many guests.  If you scroll down the page, you can explore more about Air BNB's story.</p>
	<p> <a href="http://www.snowbird.com/" target="_blank">Snowbird</a> uses more of a grid layout.  There is a beautiful picture of a skier hitting the slopes in the top left quadrant, which is below the logo as well as a options for Winter, Summer, Lodging etc.  In the upper right quadrant you can hover over the weather and it pops out to show more details.  The lower left quadrant has rotating links offering such things as employment, season passes and getaway weekends.  In the bottom right quadrant is the most simple unordered list of Buying Online options and their toll free number.</p>
		
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both websites use pictures effectively to draw customers in to explore the content within each site.  <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Air BNB</a> is more vertical in its layout and really wants the customer to search for homes whereas <a href="http://www.snowbird.com/" target="_blank">snowbird</a> offers the user multiple choices in a smaller space.</p>
